# Overview
SEIRD_model is a tool that gives the user an ability to see how an epidemiological model (in this case SEIRD) works through hands on experimentation. Created specifically with educational purposes in mind. 

# Functionalities
- changing every parameter used to solve the model
- seeing the statistics for currently chosen parameters
- seeing how the change of parameters affects the course of an epidemic through graphs showing how each age group in each category behaves
- saving earlier mentioned parameters for future use
- loading parameters from a csv file
- saving statistics to a csv for further analysis
- saving shown graphs to a file
- zooming in on the graphs
- moving through graphs
